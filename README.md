Module 1 homework assignment
# <Module 1 Homework: Horiseon Homepage>

## Description

- This particular homework assignment focused on use of semantic HTML elements, organizing and consolidating HTML and CSS to make cleaner code, using comments to describe what is happening in the code, and ensuring all images and icons are accessible using alt attributes (can be read by a screen reader).
- Through a process of trial and error, I learned how to consolidate the HTML and CSS code to simplify it, as well as how to add alt attributes to the img sections to add the descriptions
- After completing the project, unecessary or redundant parts of the code have been eliminated, and images and icons have alt descriptions for accessibility
- This homework assignment meets all the acceptance criteria listed below:
    - Must have semantic HTML elements
        - The original html primarily used "div" to divide up the sections, however this can make it more difficult to understand the intended content of each section, so instead the divs were re-labeled as header, section, article, aside, and <footer> to better organize the code
    - Elements must follow logical structure independent of styling and positioning
        - The HTML elements were ordered in a systematic way moving down the page, however the accompanying CSS style sheet presented the elements in an unordered way. The CSS style sheet was re-arranged to more closely match the order of the HTML.
    - Icon and image elements must have accessible alt attritbutes
        - Each image on the page has an associated alt of accessible text description so that a screen reader may interpret the image for the user in words. Even the heart emoji at the bottom of the page has alt text.
    - Heading attributes are in sequential order
        - Headings were labeled in sequential order, with the header containing h1, the article containing h2s, the aside containing h3s, and the footer containing h4s.
    - Title element is concise and descriptive
        - The title in the head section was concisely named 'Horiseon Homepage'
- All links are functional in the navigation bar

## Usage

If you want to check that each image is indeed accessible to screen readers, you can right click on each on individually, click "Inspect" from the drop down menu, and the description should appear in a separate chrome dev tool column.
